    <h1>Jorge Garcia's Profile page</h1>
    <p>I am a Senior Computer Information Systems major and I was born in Cuba.
        My life has been filled with interesting and important life events which have
        led me to this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is my dream to finally get out of school and make a name for myself in the world.
        I look behind at my life with regret, but at the future with hopefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
        I now have the skills required to push myself onto better opportunities in the future.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I've always wanted to see more and do more. I wanted to become an astronaut and soar above the skies onto places no one has ever
        been before. Hopefully I get to do that in this lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy exploration, engineering of things (I got that from my dad) and to fix things.
        I am a very utilitarian person, loving to find the use in things (no matter how small).
    </p>
    <p>I love to play games and sometimes I play too much of them. I like to keep busy with work related to my field and helping other people.
        I have a lot of things I want to do but have not had the chance to. I enjoy looking at the stars.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>It is going to be a scary process to move to the real world now.</p>
